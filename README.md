### Business Problem 
OPI is seeking to expand their product portfolio as a means to maintain their status as a market leader in the nail industry. The product should reflect the brand's standard for excellence, be environmentally conscious, and have an ROI of greater than 30%.

### Approach 
Through market, supply chain, customer, and concept analyses, our team was able to generate, test, and identify a single product for consideration for production: Odorless gel polish. Financial analyses were completed for the selected concept to identify its viability to reach the ROI goals for the company. A complete implmentation plan is also provided to guide next steps in the product development cycle.

### Takeaways
- Multiple data-driven metrics are essential to ensure product viability and success
- The new product development process can be optimized via agile methodology to account for changing industry and consumer needs that emerge from ongoing analyses
- Sometimes the concepts you least expect to succeed, end up having the greatest implications. Check your biases and your data!
